# Guidelines for Submitting Documents
## General Guidelines 
- Please submit the following documents: 
  1. A .Rmd document that you used to write your code
  2. A .md document that is a result of your code 
  3. All the figures that are created by your code (by default these
    are stored in a sub-folder, and linked in the .md document).
	  	  
## Assignment Turnin Guidelines

1. To start, [**fork** the repository][forking].
2. [**Clone**][ref-clone] the repository to your computer.
3. Do work! Modify the files and [**commit**][ref-commit] this work. 
4. [**Push**][ref-push]/sync the changes up to your GitHub fork.
5. [Create a **pull request**][pull-request] on the original
   repository to turn in the assignment.
   
This [video](https://youtu.be/CN_UIk451Xw) walks you through the
submission process if this flow is unfamiliar to you. 

Ten percent -- a full grade on this assignment -- of your grade is
*freely* given, just by submitting your assignment following these
contribution guidelines. 

# Feedback 

We take an intentional approach to feedback in w241. We want you to
get notice as quickly as possible for areas that require your
review. We want you to compare your work against our reference
work. And then we want you to talk your colleagues in the class --
both your peers and faculty -- about how to improve. 

To this end: 

1. We will release solution sets to the entire section three days
   after the assignment is due. We will not accept assignments after
   this time, without prior conversation with your instructor. 
2. We will release solution videos -- where faculty have coded their
   approach to solving a question -- at the same time. 
3. We will hold a faculty-led homework debrief on the Saturday morning
   that follows your homework submission. 
4. And, we would be *exceedingly* happy to talk about the approach you
   took to answering a question in any regularily-scheduled office
   hours. 

# General Guidance 

- Please ask us questions about the problem set if you get
  stuck. *Donâ€™t spend more than 20 minutes puzzling over what a
  problem means!*
- You do not need to show work for trivial calculations, but showing
  work is always allowed.
- For answers that involve a narrative response, please feel free to
  describe the key concept directly and briefly, if you can do so. Do
  not feel pressure to go on at length.
- For text answers, please **embolden** your answers to the questions.
- Use inline code evaluation to write your answers.


# Working Collaboratively
We come from PhD programs where all of the students (now faculty @
UCB, Harvard, Princeton, UCLA, UofMichigan, UT-Austin) worked together
to make everyone better. We think that the *collaborative* model is a
fantastic model, and We want to bring it forward into this class. Talk
with your friends, work together on homework, create study groups. We
are *certain* that you will learn more from each other this way, than
is possible to learn from the instructors. 

However, collaboration does not mean:

- Free-riding on your classmates;
- Sending code without conversation, and especially, 
- Downloading solutions from past semesters.

If you have a question of whether what you're doing is collaborative
or not, consider whether the person or thing on the other end of the
collaboration could benefit in some form. If the answer is no, or it
is murky, then it is not collaboration.

In particular, We bet you can find a solution set for each of these
problem sets with enough looking around. Heck, if you want, We'll tell
you where they are.

*But, don't.*

To do so would be a *severe* violation of the trust that We've got in
you, our students. And, _know_ that if you do, We'll be able to
tell. We wrote these problems and solution sets, and it is remarkably
easy to tell one's own words and coding idioms. Currently, We figure
that We're batting 1.000 catching people who have broken the classes'
collective trust.
