# Experiment and Causal Inference

This is the repo for the assignments and notes for the class, Experiment and Causal Inference. The assignments focus on identifying causal relationships using the potential outcome framework and regression analysis. The programming language of choice for this class is R. There are a total of five assignments and their respective areas of focus are as follows:

* [Assignment 1](https://github.com/erikhou45/experiment-causal-inference/blob/master/w241-ps1-summer2020-section1/ps1.pdf): Introduce and reason about the potential outcome framework.

* [Assignment 2](https://github.com/erikhou45/experiment-causal-inference/blob/master/w241-ps2-summer2020-section1/ps2.Rmd): Use Randomized Inference for hypothesis testing and explore the effect of block and cluster randomization on experiment power.

* [Assignment 3](https://github.com/erikhou45/experiment-causal-inference/blob/master/w241-ps3-summer2020-section1/ps3.pdf): Analyze multifactor experiments with regression to determine the average treatment effects of different treatments.
 
* [Assignment 4](https://github.com/erikhou45/ml-at-scale/blob/master/Assignments/HW4/hw4_workbook.ipynb): How to determine the effect of treatment when there is non-compliance.

* [Assignment 5](https://github.com/erikhou45/ml-at-scale/blob/master/Assignments/HW5/hw5_workbook.ipynb): More on non-compliance and introduce causal inference using observational data.
